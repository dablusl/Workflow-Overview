Tower Control for Logistics Operation


Hi ! I divide this project in :

- Com√®teSP ( Warehouse ERP )
  C# .NET Desktop App 
  I'm only going to focus in the models for the back-end since the goal is business analytics and management, and not the logistics operations. ( GUI for the ERP, maybe some other day)
  Based in the class Diagramme in ./UML/UML_ERP inspired in my Supply Chain experience working with LMxt, Kisoft and Bowas 2.0

- Monocle ( DSS )
  Typescript Next.js
  Interactive DSS for a solid number based management. Monocle DSS queries the warehouse ERP for data but also has it's own db for plannificagion and company data ...
  Monocle is a tribute to all the excel spread sheets and macros that do wonders, in a new centralized uniform and robust tool.
